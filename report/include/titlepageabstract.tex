\begin{abstract}
  This thesis presents ideas for how to implement Stack Traces for
  the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. The goal is to come up with an
  implementation with such small overhead that even binaries in
  production servers should not hesitate to use it. Since the
  implementation is aiming for maximum efficiency it will be heavily
  tied to only GHC. This work has been made possible thanks to a very
  recent contribution \cite{DBLP:conf/haskell/WortmannD13} which
  implemented debug data for binaries compiled with GHC, allowing
  this thesis to almost entirely focus on managing the GHC stack. We
  will look both at how to reify the GHC stack and what Haskell API
  that should be exposed to the Haskell programmers. Unfortunately no
  complete implementation is created and no benchmarks can verify that
  the proposed implementations have a low overhead. Yet, we are
  hopeful, because the analysis suggests that the implementation will
  only have a low constant factor. By utilizing laziness and the special
  linked list structure of the GHC stack, we can implement stack traces
  as first class values and do efficient stack reifications. While Haskell
  has thus far have had a bad reputation when it comes to stack traces, it
  will be in a much better shape than both Java and Python if the actual
  implementation works out.
