\begin{abstract}

  This thesis presents ideas for how to implement Stack Traces
  for the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. The goal is to come up with
  an implementation with such small overhead that even binaries
  in production servers should not hesitate to use it. Since the
  implementation is aiming for maximum efficiency it will be heavily
  tied to only GHC. This work has been made possible thanks to a very
  recent contribution \cite{DBLP:conf/haskell/WortmannD13} that
  implements debug data for binaries compiled with GHC. Thanks to that
  contribution, this thesis can almost entirely focus on managing
  the GHC stack. We will look both at how to reify the GHC stack and
  what Haskell API that should be exposed to the programmers.
  Unfortunately no complete implementation is created and no benchmarks
  can verify that the proposed implementations have a low overhead. Yet,
  we are hopeful, because the analysis suggests that most implementation ideas
  will have a low overhead.
    By utilizing laziness and the special linked list structure of the
  GHC stack, we can implement stack traces as first class values and do
  efficient stack reifications. Thus far Haskell have a bad reputation
  when it comes to stack traces, but if the actual implementation works
  out, it will be in a much better shape than both Java and Python.
