\begin{abstract}

  Thus far Haskell have a bad reputation when it comes to stack traces.
  This thesis presents ideas for how to implement Stack Traces
  for the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. The goal is to come up with
  an implementation with such small overhead that organizations do not
  hesitate to use it for their binaries running in production. Since the
  implementation is aiming for maximum efficiency it will be heavily
  tied to only GHC. This work has been made possible thanks to a very
  recent contribution \cite{DBLP:conf/haskell/WortmannD13} that
  implements debug data for binaries compiled with GHC. Thanks to that
  contribution, this thesis can almost entirely focus on managing
  the GHC stack. We will look both at how to reify the GHC stack and
  what Haskell API that should be exposed to the programmers.
  Our analysis suggests that some of our implementation ideas
  do have a low overhead by utilizing laziness and the special linked list structure of the
  GHC stack. The stack values representing the GHC Stack will be first class values and they
  can be reified efficiently. If the actual implementation works
  out, stack values in Haskell will be more flexible than stack values in Java and Python.
